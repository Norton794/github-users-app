# GitHub user search app

Project made based on [this](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6) Frontend Mentor challenge.

I'm not a premium member so the intended project and mine are slightly (to say the least) different...

```
# Clone the repository
$ git clone <https://github.com/Norton794/github-users-app.git>

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Execute the application
$ npm start

# The server will initialize in <http://localhost:3000> 
```

#### Still in development
